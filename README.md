# Hey, I’m Andrew 👋

**CS (CE) + EE Double Major @ The Colorado School of Mines (’27) | iOS / Full-Stack Developer | Collaborative Engineer**

I build end-to-end systems where software meets real world constraints; I ship both iOS and full-stack applications that integrate with devices, data, and automation. With a Computer Science and Electrical Engineering foundation, I focus on clean UI/UX, reliable architecture, and measurable results, from hardware-connected workflows to analytics platforms and scalable tooling.

**Accessibility-first iOS app for connecting and managing assistive hardware**
- Built a production-minded iOS app in **Swift / SwiftUI**, integrating **CoreBluetooth** to discover, connect, and manage assistive devices (haptic wristband + computer vision glasses).  
- Designed user flows with **accessibility** as a first-class requirement, prioritizing clear UX, strong feedback states, and reliable device interaction for blind and low-vision users.  
- Implemented **local persistence (SQLite)** for user/device state and supported secure cloud deployment patterns on **AWS** to enable scalable data storage and future syncing.  
- Worked in an **agile** workflow (Jira, standups), collaborating closely with a small team to deliver features iteratively, fix edge cases, and keep the app stable under real use.  

### Computer Science Teaching Assistant — The Colorado School of Mines (Part-time)
**CSCI128: Introduction to Computer Science for STEM**
- Supported course delivery by developing and refining labs/assignments on core topics including **functions, strings/lists, classes, and recursion**, helping students build strong programming fundamentals.  
- Built **Python automation tooling** to streamline authentication, grading, and feedback workflows for **1,000+ submissions**, improving accuracy, turnaround time, and consistency across sections.

## Featured projects

### [Athlete Statistical Modeling Platform — Engineering Champions](https://github.com/jacksonzimm23/EngineeringChampions)
**Full-stack analytics platform + statistical modeling + automated PDF reporting**
- Built a full-stack web platform using **React, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, Flask/Python, and MySQL** to ingest athlete data and generate usable performance insights.  
- Implemented **authentication** and a structured, template-based data pipeline to standardize input, reduce manual formatting, and keep datasets consistent across users.  
- Automated **PDF report generation** that ranks athletes on a **0–100** scale and surfaces supporting stats, turning raw data into coach-friendly summaries.  
- Shipped as part of a **4-person Scrum team** during a 5-week Mines CS field session, contributing across frontend, backend, and data features.  

### [Clash of Clans Clue Game](https://github.com/Nick-Silzell/ClueGame)
**Interactive web game inspired by Clue, themed around Clash of Clans**
- Built an interactive deduction-style game where players uncover the correct **suspect / weapon / location** combination through structured clues and elimination logic.  
- Designed a clean UI and game flow with reusable components, focusing on fast iteration, responsive layout, and a polished “playable” experience.  
- Implemented game-state management (turns, notes, clue reveals) to keep gameplay consistent and easy to extend with new characters, maps, and clue sets.
